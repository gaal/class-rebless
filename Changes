* This be 0.05.
* The fix from 0.04 was bogus. Detract bogosity.
* Native filehandles are GLOBs, but their ARRAY slots are not defined.
  This was causing crashes, so guard against that case.
* Clean up closures generating editors. The module is now marginally faster
  but the code is hopefully clearer.
* Clean up docs and tests.

* This be 0.04.
* Don't warn on undef values when using custom editor (closes: #6153).
* Tests. Thanks, Gabor Szabo!
