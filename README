Class::Rebless - Rebase namespaces, hierarchically

Class::Rebless takes a Perl data structure and recurses through its
hierarchy, reblessing objects that it finds along the way into new
namespaces. This is typically useful when your object belongs to a
package that is too close to the main namespace for your tastes, and
you want to rebless everything down to your project's base namespace.
