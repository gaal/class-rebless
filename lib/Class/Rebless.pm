=head1 NAME

Class::Rebless - Rebase deep data structures

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Class::Rebless;

  my $beat = bless({
    one => bless({
      hey => 'ho',
    }, 'AOne'),
    two => bless({
      list => [
        bless({ three => 3 }, 'AThree'),
        bless({ four  => 4 }, 'AFour'),
        5,
        "this is just noise",
      ],
    }, 'ATwo'),
    six => {
      seven => bless({ __VALUE__ => 7}, 'ASeven'),
      eight => bless({ __VALUE__ => 8}, 'AnEight'),
    },
  }, 'AOne');

  Class::Rebless->rebase($beat, 'And');

  # $beat now contains objects of type
  # And::AOne, And::ATwo .. And::AnEight!

  Class::Rebless->rebless($beat, 'Beatless');

  # All (blessed) objects in $beat now belong to package
  # Beatless.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Class::Rebless takes a Perl data structure and recurses through its
hierarchy, reblessing objects that it finds along the way into new
namespaces. This is typically useful when your object belongs to a
package that is too close to the main namespace for your tastes, and
you want to rebless everything down to your project's base namespace.

Class::Rebless walks scalar, array, and hash references. It uses
Scalar::Util::reftype to discover how to walk blessed objects of any type.

=head1 METHODS

Class::Rebless defines B<only class methods>. There is no instance
constructor, and when calling these methods you should take care not
to call them in function form by mistake; that would not do at all.

=head2 Reblessing Methods

All these methods take arguments like this:

    Class::Rebless->method($root, $namespace, \%opts);

The C<$root> object is the place where the visitor begins to crawl the
structure for things to rebless.

The C<$namespace> is used differently by different methods, generally as the
class name or partial class name into which to rebless objects.  Some
reblessing methods may ignore it entirely.

The C<\%opts> hashref is a container for the rest of the options.  They are:

    editor  - the coderef used to rebless;  It is called for each object
              with the object and $namespace as its argument.  This option
              is set by default by the "rebless" and "rebase" methods, and
              is in fact all they do.

    revisit - If true, the visitor will descend into references it has seen
              before.  By default, it is false, and once a reference has
              been visited once, it will not be visited again.

=head3 rebless

    Class::Rebless->rebless($myobj, "New::Namespace");

Finds all blessed objects refered to by $myobj and reblesses them into
New::Namespace. This completely overrides whatever blessing they had
before.

=head3 rebase

    Class::Rebless->rebase($myobj, "New::Namespace::Root");

Finds all blessed objects refered to by $myobj and reblesses them into
new namespaces relative to New::Namespace::Root. This overrides whatever
blessing they had before, but unlike B<rebless>, it preseves something
of the original name. So if you had an object blessed into "MyClass",
it will now be blessed into "New::Namespace::Root::MyClass".

=head3 custom

    Class::Rebless->custom($myobj, "MyName", { editor => \&my_editor });

Per each visited object referenced in $myobj, calls my_editor() on it.
The editor routine is passed the current object in the recursion and
the wanted namespace ("MyName" in the code above).  This lets you to
do anything you like with each object, but is (at least nominally)
intended to allow filtering out objects you don't want to rebless. 3rd
party objetcs, for example:

    my $fh      = IO::File->new("data") or die "open:$!";
    my $frobber = Frotz->new({ source => $fh });
    Class::Rebless->custom($frobber, "SuperFrotz", { editor => \&noio });

    sub noio {
        my($obj, $namespace) = @_;
        return if ref($obj) =~ /^IO::/;

        bless $obj, $namespace . '::' . ref $obj;
    }

(A more realistic example might actually use an inclusion filter, not
an inclusion filter.)

=head2 prune

    Class::Rebless->prune("__PRUNE__");
    Class::Rebless->custom($myobj, "MyName", { editor => \&pruning_editor });

When pruning is turned on, a custom reblesser has the opportunity to prune
(skip) subtrees in the recursion of $myobj. All it needs to do to signal
this is to return the string set in advance with the prune method.

This feature is useful, like custom, for when you don't want to mess
with members belonging to 3rd party classes that your object might be
holding. Using the noio example above, the "return" can be changed to
"return '__PRUNE__'". Anything the IO object refers to will not be
visited by Class::Rebless.

=head1 CAVEATS

Reblessing a tied object may produce unexpected results.
